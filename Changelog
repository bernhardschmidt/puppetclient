2015-01-02 Bernhard Schmidt - 0.2.1
 * use str2bool to convert upstreamrepository to a boolean variable, you
   don't have to be careful about the correct type anymore

2015-01-01 Bernhard Schmidt - 0.2.0
 * use deep_merge() from puppetlabs-stdlib 4.2.0
 * drop templatedir, manifest and modulepath from default configuration
   according to
   https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/environments_classic.html#config-file-environments-are-deprecated

2014-01-20 Bernhard Schmidt - 0.1.4
 * puppetclient is now compatible with parser=future

2013-06-15 Bernhard Schmidt - 0.1.3
 * Add Ubuntu support (handle it like Debian)
   Thanks to Elias Probst for the patch

2013-05-25 Bernhard Schmidt - 0.1.2
 * Fixes for Puppet 3.2
   - Also add dependencies section of the Puppetlabs APT repository
   - cron: add --no-daemonize option and redirect to /dev/null, workaround
     for https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/20900
   - Fix depreciation warning in puppet.conf.erb

2013-04-12 Bernhard Schmidt - 0.1.1
 * Add changelog
 * Order sections and keys in generated configfile to get a 
   predictable output
 * Do not stop Service['puppet'] with startmode 'cron' or 'manual', it
   often also kills the manually started instance like a self-destruct.
   This might leave a daemon process running when initially switching to
   another start mode, but this is definitely the lesser evil right now.
 * New parameter puppetclient::config::configfile to set filename of the
   generated config file, add example to README.md
