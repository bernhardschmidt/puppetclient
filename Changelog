2013-05-25 Bernhard Schmidt - 0.1.2
 * Fixes for Puppet 3.2
   - Also add dependencies section of the Puppetlabs APT repository
   - cron: add --no-daemonize option and redirect to /dev/null, workaround
     for https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/20900
   - Fix depreciation warning in puppet.conf.erb

2013-04-12 Bernhard Schmidt - 0.1.1
 * Add changelog
 * Order sections and keys in generated configfile to get a 
   predictable output
 * Do not stop Service['puppet'] with startmode 'cron' or 'manual', it
   often also kills the manually started instance like a self-destruct.
   This might leave a daemon process running when initially switching to
   another start mode, but this is definitely the lesser evil right now.
 * New parameter puppetclient::config::configfile to set filename of the
   generated config file, add example to README.md
